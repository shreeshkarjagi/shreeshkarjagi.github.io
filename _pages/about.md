Hi! I'm Shreesh, and welcome to my little corner of the internet :) I’m a bioengineer passionate about advancing therapies for neurological and psychiatric disorders. Currently, I’m a research assistant in Dr. Bronte-Stewart’s [Human Motor Control and Neuromodulation Lab](https://med.stanford.edu/bronte-stewart-lab.html) at Stanford Neurology, where I work on optimizing adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) for Parkinson’s Disease. My research focuses on analyzing neural and kinematic data to improve patient outcomes in clinical and home settings.

I graduated from UCLA with a B.S. in Bioengineering, where I worked in Dr. Jun Chen’s [Wearable Bioelectronics Lab](https://www.junchenlab.com/). There, I contributed to projects under the mentorship of Dr. Xun Zhao in wearable sensors and bioelectronics, from smart bedsheets for sleep monitoring to developing ultrasensitive acoustic sensors for voice recoginition. 

This site is where I share my journey, ideas, and achievements as I work toward bridging engineering innovation with impactful advancements in neurology. Thanks for stopping by!
