Hi! I'm Shreesh, and welcome to my little corner of the internet :) I’m passionate about advancing therapies for neuropsychiatric disorders. Currently, I'm a Ph.D. student in the
[Structured Information for Precision Neuroengineering Lab (SIPLab)](https://siplab.gatech.edu/index.html) at Georgia Tech & Emory, advised by [Dr. Christopher J. Rozell](https://siplab.gatech.edu/rozell.html) & [Dr. Sankar Alagapan](https://www.sankaralagapan.com/).

My interests are in neuromodulation, machine learning, and digital health technologies, with a focus on clinical applications of AI to better understand brain and behavior with the goal of improving patient outcomes.

Before grad school, I was a research assistant in Dr. Bronte-Stewart’s [Human Motor Control and Neuromodulation Lab](https://med.stanford.edu/bronte-stewart-lab.html) at Stanford Neurology. There, I contributed to adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) studies for Parkinson’s disease, focusing on neural and kinematic analyses of gait impairment
and advancing remote health technologies for clincal decision support.

I graduated from UCLA with a B.S. in Bioengineering, where I worked in Dr. Jun Chen’s [Wearable Bioelectronics Lab](https://www.junchenlab.com/). There, I contributed to projects under the mentorship of [Dr. Xun Zhao](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/xun-zhao) in wearable sensors and bioelectronics, from smart bedsheets for sleep monitoring to developing ultrasensitive acoustic sensors for voice recoginition. 

This site is where I share my journey, ideas, and achievements as I work toward bridging engineering innovation with advancements in medicine. Thanks for stopping by!
